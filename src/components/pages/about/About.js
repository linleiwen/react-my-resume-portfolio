          Prior to Maxâ€™s enrollment in GWU MSBA, he independently watched and learned much about data cleaning, data base management, machine learning and data visualization through courses provided by Udemy, Coursera and Udacity. He is seeking opportunities in the data analytics industry. He is thirsty for connecting with more like-minded, talented peers who share his love of data technology. The cool and smart technology industry fascinates him with a larger group of constantly innovating souls than in any other sectors. Seeking career development along this track is more than finding a job but embracing fun and challenges for him!
